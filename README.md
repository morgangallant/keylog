__keylog__ is a simple tool used to monitor the number of keystrokes performed on a machine. It was built as a way to better understand personal productivity patterns, and _should not_ be used for nefarious purposes. Right now, the tool is incredibly simplistic and only supports linux. Please feel free to add MacOS/Windows support.

In terms of usage, the intended workflow is for this tool to be run as some sort of systemd job, and post counts to an endpoint of your choice every x hours. As per usage, you can get help by passing the `--help` flag to the binary. I made a conscious choice to force the user to enter a custom endpoint for post requests, since we wouldn't want the site owners of `example.com` getting too angry with us :)
